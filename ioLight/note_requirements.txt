Installation Instructions:
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

Note for the MicroPython Code (main.py):
This firmware runs on IoT devices using MicroPython, which doesn't use Python package managers like pip. Dependencies are typically managed via:

Manual inclusion of MicroPython libraries

Device-specific firmware builds

upip (MicroPython's package manager) for compatible libraries

No requirements.txt is needed for the MicroPython portion.
